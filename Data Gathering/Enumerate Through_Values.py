#This code dowload the Yelp db business rating, number of reviews and details.
#The method utilised was based on geospatial location since yelp restricts the total offset number and the location is inclomplete for some cases.
#Thus each London area was modifies on ArcGis and centroids were calculated.
#Then each shape/area was enclosed in a rectangle and the sides size were calculated.
#Then in another code we utilised pythagoreum to calculate diameter and radius of each search parameter/area.
#Then we used those centroids cartesian coordinates along with radius to search for the businesses on Yelp.
#Import the required libraries
